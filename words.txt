have stated that The Design of Everyday Things was required reading for
their staffs. This book has succeeded.
So show me more of those Norman doors, those faucets, those plastic
bags of food that can be opened only by ripping them with the teeth. Show
me more of those automobile radios, such as the one in my own car, with
rows of tiny identical buttons that can't possibly be operated while driving.
The problems sound trivial, but they can mean the difference between
pleasure and frustration. The same principles that make these simple
things work well or poorly apply to more complex operations, including
ones in which human lives are at stake. Most accidents are attributed to
human error, but in almost all cases the human error was the direct result
of poor design. The principles that guide a quality, human-centered design
are not relevant just to a more pleasurable life—they can save lives.

The Hidden Frustrations of Everyday Things
Before I wrote this book, I was a cognitive scientist, interested in how the

mind works. I studied human perception, memory, and attention. I exam-
ined how people learned, how they performed skilled activities. Along the

way, I became interested in human error, hoping that my understanding of
error would provide ways to teach people how to avoid mistakes. But then
came the nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island in the United
States, and I was among a group of social and behavioral scientists who
were called in to determine why the control-room operators had made
such terrible mistakes. To my surprise, we concluded that they were not to
blame: the fault lay in the design of the control room. Indeed, the control
panels of many power plants looked as if they were deliberately designed
to cause errors.

My interest in accidents led me to the study of human-centered devel-
opment procedures that might eliminate those problems. I spent a sabbat-
ical year in Cambridge, England, at the Medical Research Council's world-
famous Applied Psychology Unit and was continually amused and frus-
trated by the workings of the building. It was difficult to figure out which

light switch controlled what light. Doors were another puzzle: some had
to be pushed, some pulled, and at least one required sliding, yet there were
no clues to the unwitting person attempting to go through the doorway.
Water taps—"faucets" in the United States—were capricious; some sinks

had the hot water on the left, some on the right. Moreover, whenever peo-
ple made errors using these ill-constructed devices, they blamed them-

selves. What was going on? Why did people blame themselves when a
device itself was at fault?
I started to observe how people coped with the numerous devices that
populate our lives. In more recent years, my studies have expanded to
include aviation safety, complex manufacturing plants, medical error, and
a wide range of consumer products such as home entertainment systems

and computers. In all these situations, people often find themselves flus-
tered and confused. Worse, serious accidents are frequently blamed on

"human error." Yet careful analysis of such situations shows that the
design or installation of the equipment has contributed significantly to the
problems. The design team or installers did not pay sufficient attention to
the needs of those who would be using the equipment, so confusion or
error was almost unavoidable. Whether kitchen stove or nuclear power
plant, automobile or aircraft, thermostat or computer, the same problems
were present. In all cases, design faults led to human error.
My frustrations while in England caused me to write The Design of
Everyday Things, but the problems I encountered there are universal and
worldwide. When I wrote the book, I was a research scientist interested in
principles of cognition. But I found myself more and more fascinated by

the way these principles could be applied to improve everyday life, to min-
imize error and accident. I changed the direction of my research to focus

on applications and design. Eventually I left my university so I could
devote myself to the development of products. I joined Apple Computer,

first as an "Apple Fellow," then as vice president of the advanced technol-
ogy group. I served as an executive at two other companies and then, with

my colleague Jakob Nielsen, cofounded a consulting company (the Nielsen
Norman group) to apply these ideas to a wider variety of firms, a wider
variety of products. It has been exciting to witness the principles in
Everyday Things realized in products.

The Book Title: A Lesson in Design
This book has been published under two titles. The first title, The
Psychology of Everyday Things—POET—was much liked by my academic
friends. The second title, The Design of Everyday Things—DOET—was more
meaningful and better conveyed the contents of the book. The editor of the

paperback edition explained to me that in bookstores, titles are what read-
ers see as their eyes wander the shelves, skimming the spines. They rely

upon the title to describe the book. I also learned that the word "psychol-
ogy" caused the book to be shelved in the psychology sections of the

stores, which drew readers who cared about people and human relation-
Preface to the 2002 Edition ix

ships rather than objects and our relationships to them. Readers interested
in design would never think of looking in the psychology section. I went

to bookstores and watched how people browsed. I talked with book buy-
ers and clerks. My editor was correct: I needed to change the word "psy-
chology" to "design." In titling my book, I had been guilty of the same

shortsightedness that leads to all those unusable everyday things! My first
choice of title was that of a self-centered designer, choosing the solution
that pleased me without considering its impact upon readers. So DOET it
became, and DOET it remains in this new edition.

Lessons from DOET
When you have trouble with things—whether it's figuring out whether to
push or pull a door or the arbitrary vagaries of the modern computer and
electronics industry—it's not your fault. Don't blame yourself: blame the
designer. It's the fault of the technology, or, more precisely, of the design.
When we first see an object we have never seen before, how do we
know how to use it? How do we manage tens of thousands of objects,

many of which we encounter only once? This question propelled the writ-
ing of DOET. The answer, I quickly determined, was that the appearance

of the device must provide the critical clues required for its proper opera-
tion—knowledge has to be both in the head and in the world.

At the time I wrote DOET, this idea was considered strange. Today,

however, the concept is more widely accepted. Many in the design com-
munity understand that design must convey the essence of a device's oper-
ation; the way it works; the possible actions that can be taken; and, through

feedback, just what it is doing at any particular moment. Design is really
an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of
the person with whom the designer is communicating.
Although DOET covers numerous topics, three have come to stand out
as critical:
1. It's not your fault: If there is anything that has caught the popular
fancy, it is this simple idea: when people have trouble with something, it

isn't their fault—it's the fault of the design. Every week brings yet anoth-
er letter or e-mail from someone thanking me for delivering them from

their feeling of incompetence.
2. Design principles: I make it a rule never to criticize something unless I
can offer a solution. DOET contains several important design principles,

powerful tools for designers to ensure that their products are understand-
x Preface to the 2002 Edition

able and usable. The principles, of course, are explained within the book,
but to give you a hint of what you will encounter, here is a short list of the
most important. Note that they are all easy to understand, yet powerful.

• Conceptual models. The human mind is a wonderful organ of under-
standing—we are always trying to find meaning in the events around us.

One of the greatest frustrations of all is trying to learn how to do some-
thing that seems completely arbitrary and capricious. Worse, when we lack

understanding, we are apt to err.
Consider the thermostat. When some people enter a cold house, they
turn the thermostat to a very high temperature in order to reach the
desired level more quickly. They do this because of their internal mental
model of how the furnace works. The model is sensible and coherent, even
if not well thought out. It is also wrong. But how would they know?

Although this behavior is wrong for the home, it works for most automo-
biles—turn the heat or air conditioning up all the way, and when the inte-
rior is at the correct temperature, adjust the temperature control again.

To understand how to use things, we need conceptual models of how
they work. Home furnaces, air conditioners, and even most household
ovens have only two levels of operation: full power or off. Therefore, they

are always heating or cooling to the desired temperature as rapidly as pos-
sible. In these cases, setting the thermostat too high does nothing but waste

energy when the temperature overshoots the target.
Now consider the automobile. The conceptual model is quite different.
Yes, the heater and air conditioner also have only two settings, full power
or off, but in many autos, the desired temperature is achieved by mixing
cold and hot air. In this case, faster results come by turning off the mixing

(by setting the temperature control to an extreme) until the desired tem-
perature is reached, then adjusting the mixture to maintain the desired

temperature.
The explanations of the home and automobiles are examples of simple
conceptual models. They are highly oversimplified but quite adequate for

understanding how they work. They make it easy for us to use very dif-
ferent behavior when in the home or in the auto. A good conceptual model

can make the difference between successful and erroneous operation of the
many devices in our lives.
This short lesson on conceptual models points out that good design is
also an act of communication between the designer and the user, except
that all the communication has to come about by the appearance of the

device itself. The device must explain itself. Even the location and opera-
tion of the controls require a conceptual model—an obvious and natural

Preface to the 2002 Edition xi

relationship between their location and the operation they control so you
always know which control does what (in the book, I call this a "natural
mapping"). When the designers fail to provide a conceptual model, we
will be forced to make up our own, and the ones we make up are apt to be
wrong. Conceptual models are critical to good design.
• Feedback. In design, it is important to show the effect of an action.

Without feedback, one is always wondering whether anything has hap-
pened. Maybe the button wasn't pushed hard enough; maybe the machine

has stopped working; maybe it is doing the wrong thing. Without feed-
back, we turn equipment off at improper times or restart unnecessarily,

losing all our recent work. Or we repeat the command and end up having
the operation done twice, often to our detriment. Feedback is critical.
• Constraints. The surest way to make something easy to use, with few
errors, is to make it impossible to do otherwise—to constrain the choices.
Want to prevent people from inserting batteries or memory cards into their
cameras the wrong way, thus possibly harming the electronics? Design
them so that they fit only one way, or make it so they work perfectly
regardless of how they were inserted.Failure to design with constraints is one reason for all those warnings
and attempts to give instructions: all those tiny diagrams on the camera, in
obscure locations, often in the same color as the case and unreadable. I look
for instructions posted on doors, cameras, and other equipment. Rule of
thumb: when instructions have to be pasted on something (push here,
insert this way, turn off before doing this), it is badly designed.
• Affordances. A good designer makes sure that appropriate actions are

perceptible and inappropriate ones invisible. DOET introduced the con-
cept of "perceived affordances" to the design community, and to my pleas-
ure, the concept has become immensely popular.

3. The power of observation: If I have been successful, DOET will change
the way you see the world. You will never look at a door or light switch the
same way again. You will become an acute observer of people, of objects,
and of the way they interact. In fact, if there is one single most important

part of the book it is this: learn to watch, learn to observe. Observe your-
self. Observe others. As the famous baseball player Yogi Berra said, "You

can observe a lot by watching." Problem is, you have to know how to
watch. Before DOET, had you seen a hapless user, whether an unknown
person or even yourself, you would have been apt to blame the person.
Now you will find yourself critiquing the design. Better yet, you will find
yourself explaining how to fix the problem.
